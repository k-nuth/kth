This release includes the following features and fixes:

- Knuth's build system ([kthbuild](https://github.com/k-nuth/kthbuild)) has been completely rewritten.
For x86-64 systems (AMD, Intel, etc.) kthbuild now supports all five industry-defined [microarchitecture levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels): x86-64-v0, x86-64-v1, x86-64-v2, x86-64-v3, and x86-64-v4
This version of node has been compiled using kthbuild v1.0.37.
We have chosen to distribute binaries compiled using the x86-64-v3 microarchitecture level.
However, if your platform does not support the x86-64-v3 microarchitecture level, kthbuild will automatically compile from source using your platform's specifications.
And if your platform is better than x86-64-v3, you can take advantage of your hardware by compiling node with `-o march_strategy=optimize`.
- Uses C++ API v0.25.0
- Support for Visual Studio (MSVC) has been temporarily discontinued.
- Some external dependencies were updated.
