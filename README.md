> High performance Bitcoin development platform.

Knuth is a high performance implementation of the Bitcoin protocol focused on users requiring extra performance and flexibility, what makes it the best platform for wallets, exchanges, block explorers and miners.

## Not just a node

Knuth is a multi-crypto full node, but it is also a development platform.

Knuth's core is written in C++20, on top of it we provide a set of libraries and modules written in various programming languages that you can use as basis for building your application.

At the moment we have libraries in the following languages: [C++](https://github.com/k-nuth/node), [C](https://github.com/k-nuth/c-api), [C#](https://github.com/k-nuth/cs-api), [Python](https://github.com/k-nuth/py-api), [Javascript](https://github.com/k-nuth/js-api) and [Golang](https://github.com/k-nuth/go-api).
You can build your own library in the language of your choice on top of our [C library](https://github.com/k-nuth/c-api).

## Performance matters

We designed Knuth to be a high performance node, so our build system has the ability to automatically detect the microarchitecture of your processor and perform an optimized build for it.

For those who don't want to wait for compilation times, we provide pre-built binaries compatible with [Intel's Haswell microarchitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)). But you don't have to worry about that, our build system will do everything for you.

## Modular architecture

Knuth is based on a modular architecture simple to modify, expand and learn.

Any protocol change can be introduced in Knuth much faster and more efficiently than in reference implementations.

## Cross-platform

Knuth can be used in any computer architecture and operating system, it only requires a 64-bit system.

Knuth has been well tested on x86-64 processors and on the following operating systems: FreeBSD, Linux, macOS and Windows. However, it is not limited to these, Knuth can be used in any computer architecture and any operating system, the only requirement is a 64-bit system.

If you find a problem in any other platform, please [let us know](https://github.com/k-nuth/kth/issues).

## Getting started

Install and run Knuth is very easy:

1. Install and configure the Knuth build helper:
```
$ pip install kthbuild --user --upgrade

$ conan config install https://github.com/k-nuth/ci-utils/raw/master/conan/config2023.zip

```

2. Install the appropriate node executable:

```
$ conan install --requires=kth/0.46.0 --update --deploy=direct_deploy
```

3. Run the node:

```
$ ./kth/bin/kth
```
For more more detailed instructions, please refer to our [documentation](https://k-nuth.github.io/docs/).
